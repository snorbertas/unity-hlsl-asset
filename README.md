# unity-hlsl-asset
Comfortably create HLSL files inside Unity for defining custom functions for your shader graphs.

I saw some people asking "How to create HLSL files in Unity". Usually the only way to create HLSL files in Unity is by manually importing a HLSL file created with 3rd party software. I found that very inconvenient so I wrote this quick Unity Editor extension for myself as a quality-of-life feature. It will automatically create an example script according to your created file name. Perhaps you will find it useful as well!

## Installation  
Download and import the unity package [here](https://github.com/snorbertas/unity-hlsl-asset/releases/tag/1.0). Alternatively you can clone the repository and put `HLSL Asset` folder inside your root `Assets` folder.

## Usage  
Right click within the Project panel to `Create -> Shader -> Custom Function (HLSL)`
